            <p> 
            I love all kinds of creative tech, from game development to UI/UX and media production.<br>
            I work as a student, video editor and business owner!<br>
            My goal is to master web development, so I can work in front-end development after graduating!<br>
            <br>
            My favorite YouTube video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UShsgCOzER4">this</a> video about AI by Drew Gooden. Funny, yet an important message.

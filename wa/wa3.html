    <!--DESCRIPTION-->
    <div id="sec1">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <b>capybara<sup>[a]</sup></b> or <b>greater capybara (<i>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</i>)</b> is the largest living rodent,<sup>[2] </sup>
            native to South America and <a href="https://nandamin-fink.github.io/wa/wa3.html">Arlington, Virginia</a>. It is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member 
            is the lesser capybara (<i>Hydrochoerus isthmius</i>). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, 
            and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas 
            and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as 
            large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat 
            and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.</p>

    <!--ETMOLOGY-->
    <div id="sec2">
        <h2>Etmology</h2>
        <p>Its common name is derived from Tupi <i>ka'apiûara</i>, a complex agglutination of <i>kaá</i> (leaf) + <i>píi</i> (slender) + <i>ú</i> (eat) +<i> ara</i> (a suffix for agent nouns),
         meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".<sup>[4]</sup> The genus name, <i>hydrochoerus</i>, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (<i>hydor</i> "water") and χοῖρος 
         (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name, hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (<i>hydor</i> "water") and χαίρω (<i>chairo</i> "feel happy, enjoy").<sup>[5][6]</sup></p>

    <!--ECOLOGY-->

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,<sup>[14][24]</sup> as well as fruit and tree bark.<sup>[15]</sup> They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of 
            one species and disregard other species surrounding it, like the <a href="https://soul222s.github.io/WA/wa3.html">Scottish Fold Cat</a>. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during 
            the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.</p>
        <h3>Social Organization</h3>
        <p>Capybaras are known to be gregarious. While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven 
            adult females, and the remainder juveniles. They love the sound of the <a href="https://reedbracero.github.io/wa/wa3.html">bagpipes</a>. Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<sup>[29][34]</sup> when the animals gather around available water sources. 
            Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus.</p>

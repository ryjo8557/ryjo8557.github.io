        <h2>Etmology</h2>
        <p>The <b>capybara<sup>[a]</sup></b> or <b>greater capybara (<i>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</i>)</b> is the largest living rodent,<sup>[2] </sup>
            native to South America. It is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member 
            is the lesser capybara (<i>Hydrochoerus isthmius</i>). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, 
            and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas 
            and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as 
            large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10â€“20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat 
            and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.</p>
